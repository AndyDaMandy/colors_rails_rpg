This a WIP Rails RPG.

The goals of the project:
1. Make use of Rails and CRUD to create a simple rpg using colors as party members.
2. Similar to other catch-em-all rpgs, you will be able to collect a variety of colors.
3. Each color will have unique properties and attacks, as well as elemental advantages/disadvantages.
4. You will need to create an account to store your colors.
